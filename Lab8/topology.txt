# Complex Network Topology for Distance Vector Routing - Multi-Iteration Convergence
# Format: Router1 Router2 Cost
# This network is designed to require multiple iterations for convergence
# Features competing paths and cascading updates

# Main linear chain (long path that will propagate slowly)
A B 1
B C 2
C D 3
D E 1
E F 2
F G 4

# Alternative paths that create competition
A H 10
H I 1
I J 1
J K 1
K G 1

# Cross connections that create multiple route options
B H 8
C I 6
D J 4
E K 7

# Additional connections that create more path options
A L 15
L M 2
M N 1
N G 3

# Connections that will cause route changes in later iterations
H L 5
I M 3
J N 2

# Additional nodes that extend the network
G O 1
